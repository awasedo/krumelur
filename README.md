## About
I've been using discord for a while and I wanted to create a bot for my server, and other servers that I like. The bot's features are both for moderation, fun and utility. Currently the bot is being developed, but it still works as it is.

These are the currently available commands:

* `Help` (obviously)

* `Say` Sends your message.

* `Embed` Embeds your message.

* `Clear` Clears given amount of messages.

*  `Addrole` Adds a role with given name and color

* `Randint` Sends a random integer between x and y.

* `Info` Sends an embed with info about the bot.
